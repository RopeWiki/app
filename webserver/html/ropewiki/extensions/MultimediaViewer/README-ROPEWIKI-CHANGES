The original .js files were modified to do a multiple browser back on close of the imageviewer window, instead of its current behavior of navigating forward to original page.

With the current behavior, the browser page history becomes confusing. For example, say you're on the Main Page, and click on a canyon in the slideshow and the page opens. Then you click on an image on that canyon page and it pops up to enlarge the image. Then you click close. Then you want to go back to the Main Page, so you click the browser back button.

With current behavior, it would navigate you back to the enlarged image, then another browser back would be back to the canyon page, then a third browser back would be back the Main Page. This is extremely confusing and clunky for the user.

Therefore these changes do a browser back on close, thereby preserving a more intuitive browser history for the user.


The checkout is branch REL1_24:
  https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-MultimediaViewer/blob/REL1_24/resources/mmv/mmv.js


The following lines were changed in the files:

mmv.bootstrap.js

 * Line 461: the "if ( !this.savedScroll ) {" was added so scroll state is only saved on initial load (it was getting overridden)
 * Line 483: this was changed to window.scrollTo() from $.scrollTo() which wasn't working


mmv.js

 * Line  22: imageLoadCount variable was added
 * Line 247: imageLoadCount set to 0 on open
 * Line 253: imageLoadCount increased for every scroll to next image
 * Line 787: line changed to "window.history.go(-imageLoadCount);" to do a browser back the number of times the 
 * Line 788: imageLoadCount reset to 0 on window close


Remaining bugs: there is still a bug where if you open the viewer, then go to one or more additional images, then do a navigate back from within browser (not clicking the MMV arrows, but the arrows in the browser itself), then close the viewer, the imageLoadCount variable was not reduced with the browser navigate back and therefore it will jump 2n additional pages back, where n is the number of browser navigate backs you did.

FYI, all of this behavior that we're trying to fix has been addressed and fixed in later versions of Mediawiki/MultimediaViewer.
